# Google Play Payments Compliance Notes

- **Policy area reviewed:** Google Play Developer Policy – Payments.
- **Billing approach:** Only Google Play Billing is used for in-app support/tip products (`support_tip_small`, `support_tip_standard`, `support_tip_plus`). No external payment links or alternative processors are presented.
- **Product positioning:** All offers are framed as optional, one-time support/tip contributions that do not unlock core functionality.
- **User messaging:** In-app copy explicitly states that support is voluntary and processed via Google Play Billing, clarifying that the app remains fully usable without paying.
